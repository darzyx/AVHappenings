## Getting Started

Here are some instructions to get this app set up for development on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To install this app you will need the following:

* A package managerâ€”either Yarn or NPM works fine. Find installation instructions for Yarn [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) and for NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). If you already have a package manager installed make sure it and it's dependencies are up to date.
* You also need create-react-app. If you don't have it, get it by opening your console/terminal and typing in either `npm install -g create-react-app` or `yarn add create-react-app`, depending on your pick of package manager.

### Installation

* Download a copy of this repository to your machine and unzip it.
* Open the unzipped folder in your console: `cd copy`. Tip: you might benefit from quickly accessing the directory by typing in `cd ` (note the space) and dragging and dropping the folder into your console window, then pressing `enter`.
* Once you've accessed the directory in the console, run either `npm install` or `yarn install`, again depending on your package manager. The installation process may take several minutes.
* Start the development server by running either `yarn start` or `npm start`.

## Dependencies
